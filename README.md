Morse_Translator
================

Java program that takes user input and encodes it into Morse Code or decodes it into English <br/>
depending on that type of input given. </br>

Input beginning with either a period or a dash is read as Morse Code and translated into English. <br/>
In all other cases, an English to Morse Code translation is attempted.

The English alphabet, integers 0-9, and symbols (period, comma, question mark, slash, at-sign) <br/>
are mapped to the corresponding Morse Code. Whitespace is mapped as a new line to denote the <br/> 
beginning of a new word.
